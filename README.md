## Food Agency and Cooking Basics

In this module we will begin to explore what it takes to cook a meal and make it taste good. What technical skills, knowledge, and outside factors influence the practice of procuring, preparing and eating food? Throughout the eight weeks, we will explore the concept of food agency as an organizing philosophy and practice that can be useful for  you as an individual cook and also for the facilitation of classes and interventions. Along the way, we will highlight key cooking techniques, food science, and sensory considerations that can help you transform the hypothetical ingredients of a diet for personal and planetary health into a real meal you can eat and enjoy. This week, you will apply some of these skills to make (and eat) your first meal for the class, a salad.

## Food Agency Introduction

First, watch this video explaining the basic components of food agency. As you watch, consider the following questions.

How you would define food agency? Would you say you have food agency? If so, is this a capacity you learned at home? At UVM? If not, what elements do you consider absent and why?
Are there any components of food agency that stand out as something you'd like to explore or develop more in your own cooking practice? What about for your studies/work?


Next, closely read the article Empowered to Cook: The crucial role of 'food agency' in making meals and respond to the prompts.
 
(You will be reading the other article in Module 2, so you can review it in advance to see how 'food agency' can be integrated into education and interventions. It will also be available in the next module.)

Learning Through Cooking Session:

Each week you will will learn about and apply key organization skills, cooking techniques, and sensory considerations that can help you transform the aspirations connected to making meals that integrate personal and planetary health into a real meal you can eat and enjoy. These skills, techniques and considerations will build upon each other, so that by the end of the course you will have a large toolkit to use for the final assignment but also beyond, in your personal and professional life. 

## Cooking Introduction

The following Cooking Introduction presentation introduces the basic concepts of food safety, knife skills, and use and identification of utensils and tools. These are some of the important building blocks of cooking that we believe help build food agency and confidence and safety in the kitchen. Whether this is a refresher or new information, you should take the time to practice these skills when cooking for this class (and ideally any other cooking you're doing these eight weeks). Repetition is the best way to master skills, so try a technique and try it again! At the end, you will be prompted to reflect on the implementation of these skills into your practice.

Sensory Introduction

Paying attention to the taste, flavor, aroma and texture of your food, both when you cook and when you eat can help you to better understand what makes you enjoy certain foods and dishes and how better to make them yourself in the kitchen. Making a meal is about more than specific tasks like chopping and stirring, it is also involves creating final products that are palatable, and hopefully, pleasurable. 


Please review the "Taste and Flavor" (pt. 2) and "Sensory Analysis" (pt 3) sections of the below Sensory Introduction presentation (you can skip pt. 1).

### Weekly Recipe Resources - Salads

First, read this article opens in new window that outlines key components of building a filling and delicious salad by Sola El-Waylly. Using Sola's advice and this recipe opens in new window as a guide, make your own salad. Our advice: you don't have to use all the suggested ingredients in this salad. Rather, it is the combination of tastes and flavors that it creates we want you to pursue, in some shape of form. Above all, we don't want you to simply open up a plastic clamshell of mesclun greens and then pour on a prepared dressing! We have annotated the recipe with suggestions for what you might skip, what you might replace and what you want to consider in terms of consistency and texture when you prepare the salad.

As you source ingredients, prepare the recipe, and finally eat the meal, reflect on your sustainability goals, your knife cuts, and how your choices impacted the sensory outcome of the dish. 

Here are some other general guides to building a salad that take a slightly different approach and could also be helpful to you as make decisions as to what ingredients and techniques you will use to make your salad:

### Chef Tips

For each module, short videos will be posted that provide more detailed instructions related to culinary skills. You can review these before you start to cook (to prepare) or afterwards (to better understand what happened).
